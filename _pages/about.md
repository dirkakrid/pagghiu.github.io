Software Mechanic, mostly in the sense that I am a Mechanical Engineer. My work involves mainly C++ and some little bits of C# / Javascript but I keep an eye on many unrelated technologies always to be learning new things.

In a past life I have been a 3D engine programmer and a vision system application engineer and product development for robotics applications in the automotive.

Today I am working as R&D Director at [Recognition Robotics](https://recognitionrobotics.com) to _"Make robotic visual guidance systems great again"_.

I can be found on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefano-cristiano-502a0519/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pagghiu_).
